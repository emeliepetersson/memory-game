## Code review
Mikaela Lundsgård:
- In index.html when using ‘class-name’ don’t use both camelCase and kebab-casing, it’s recommend to choose one and stay consistent. 
- It would be really cool if high scores were sorted. 
- When opening a card for the first time, the picture takes a few seconds to show up. 
- Great code and fun game!
